I have always wondered how to improve EDA on my DS projects. While doing so, I have acknowledged the importance of using plots for getting a first 
understanding of my data.

In this blog post, I want to kick-off a series of posts related to:
1. which plots seem to be of greater priority for understanding better my data
2. how to build on these plots for doing more in-depth statistical analyses (e.g. for inference)
