I've decided to dive deep into Python by working through "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho. Here's what I've picked up while doing so.

## Why Fluent Python?
In short, the person I have most learned from on Python recommended it to me. I purchased it, no questions asked.

For the moment, I expect "Fluent Python" to push me to think more in-depth about the language, particularly about the following:
- Python's data model and special methods
- Object-oriented programming patterns
- Functional programming concepts
- Metaprogramming and decorators
- Concurrency and asyncio


## Learning path
### Week 1: The Python Data Model
* The Python Data Model = Pythonâ€™s Internal API
* Special Methods Enable Rich Behavior
* Embrace Duck Typing
