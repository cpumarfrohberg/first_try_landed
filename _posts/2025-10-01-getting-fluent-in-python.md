I've decided to dive deep into Python by working through "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho. Here's what I've picked up while doing so.

## Why Fluent Python?
In short, the person I have most learned from on Python recommended it to me. I purchased it, no questions asked.

For the moment, I expect "Fluent Python" to push me to think more in-depth about the language, particularly about the following:
- Python's data model and special methods
- Object-oriented programming patterns
- Functional programming concepts
- Metaprogramming and decorators
- Concurrency and asyncio


## Learning path
### Week 1: The Python Data Model
* The Python Data Model = Python's Internal API
* Special Methods Enable Rich Behavior
* Embrace Duck Typing

## The tip of an iceberg: Python Data Model

Ever wonder why we call `len(collection)`, instead of `collection.len()`? This oddity is the tip of an iceberg: the *Python Data Model*. It defines the **special methods** (often called *dunder methods*, like `__getitem__`, `__len__`, `__repr__`) that classes can implement.

Hence, objects integrate naturally with Python's syntax and built-ins: batteries included ðŸ”‹!

- `len(obj)` calls `obj.__len__()`
- `obj[i]` calls `obj.__getitem__(i)`
- `print(obj)` calls `obj.__str__()` or `obj.__repr__()`

## Special Methods

To better appreciate the "batteries included"-aspect of implementing special methods, consider this example:

```python
import collections

Card = collections.namedtuple("Card", ["rank", "suit"])

class FrenchDeck:
    ranks = [str(n) for n in range(2, 11)] + list("JQKA")
    suits = "spades diamonds clubs hearts".split()

    def __init__(self):
        self._cards = [
            Card(rank, suit) for suit in self.suits for rank in self.ranks
        ]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._cards)

    def __getitem__(self, position):
        return self._cards[position]
```

Now we can be super flexible ðŸ•º with the batteries:

```python
from random import choice

deck = FrenchDeck()
len(deck)  # Works because of __len__

choice(deck)  # Works because of __getitem__

# Slicing works because of __getitem__
deck[:3]

# Iteration works because of __getitem__
for card in deck:
    print(card)

# Reversed iteration works
for reversed_card in reversed(deck):
    print(reversed_card)

# Sorting works
suit_vals = {"spades": 3, "hearts": 2, "diamonds": 1, "clubs": 0}

def spades_high(card: Card) -> int:
    rank_value = FrenchDeck.ranks.index(card.rank)
    return rank_value * len(suit_vals) + suit_vals[card.suit]

for sorted_card in sorted(deck, key=spades_high):
    print(sorted_card)
```

So `__getitem__` enables us to slice, iterate through our instance and sort it! Why? Because when we implement special methods like `__getitem__` and `__len__`, `FrenchDeck` behaves like a standard Python *sequence* ðŸ’¡!

While `FrenchDeck` implicitly inherits from `object`, **most of its functionality is not inherited**, but comes from leveraging the Data Model as well as from composition.

## How to use Special Methods

Coming back to our initial question of why `len(collection)`, instead of `collection.len()`:

- Special methods **are meant to be called by the Python interpreter, not by you**
- Meaning that if `my_object` is an instance of a user defined class, then `len(my_object)` calls the `__len__` you implemented
- Normally, you should be implementing special methods more often than invoking them explicitly
- If you need to invoke a special method, it's usually better to call the related built-in function (e.g. `len`, `iter`, `str`,...) (the latter call special methods themselves, which is often faster)
- The only exception is `__init__`

## The Most Important Uses of Special Methods

- Emulating Numeric Types
- String Representation
- Boolean Value of a Custom Type

## String Representation: `__repr__` and `__str__`

### `__repr__`

The `__repr__` special method is called by the `repr` built-in to get the string-representation of the object for inspection. If you don't implement it, Python falls back to the default implementation from object, which looks like:

```python
<ClassName object at 0x...>
```

If you do implement it, your objects show meaningful info in:
- The interactive console (REPL, Jupyter, etc.)
- Debugging logs
- Collections (lists, dicts) â€” because they call `repr` on their elements

Example usage:

```python
class Card:
    def __init__(self, rank, suit):
        self.rank = rank
        self.suit = suit

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Card({self.rank!r}, {self.suit!r})"
```

The `!r` in an f-string calls `repr()` on the variable, ensuring the representation is unambiguous (e.g., includes quotes around strings, as in `Vector(1,2)` vs `Vector('1','2')`).

### `__str__`

It's called by `str()` built-in and implicitly used by the `print` function: it **should return a string suitable for display to end users**.

### `__repr__` vs `__str__`

#### Behavior
- `repr(obj)` â†’ calls `obj.__repr__()`
- `str(obj)` â†’ calls `obj.__str__()`, but falls back to `__repr__()` if not implemented
- Interactive consoles (`>>> obj`) and containers (`[obj]`) use `__repr__`

Additional example:

```python
class Card:
    def __init__(self, rank, suit):
        self.rank = rank
        self.suit = suit

    def __repr__(self):
        # Developer-focused: unambiguous, includes quotes
        return f"Card({self.rank!r}, {self.suit!r})"

    def __str__(self):
        # User-focused: friendly, readable
        return f"{self.rank} of {self.suit}"
```

And usage:

```python
c = Card("7", "hearts")

print(repr(c))   # Calls __repr__
# Output: Card('7', 'hearts')

print(str(c))    # Calls __str__
# Output: 7 of hearts

print(c)         # Also calls __str__
# Output: 7 of hearts

cards = [c]
print(cards)     # Uses __repr__ for contained objects
# Output: [Card('7', 'hearts')]
```

#### Best practices
- Always implement `__repr__` in custom classes â€” it's invaluable for debugging
- Make `__repr__` unambiguous; use `!r` in f-strings for clarity
- Use `__str__` only if you want a different user-facing display. (if not, Python will fall back to `__repr__` automatically)
